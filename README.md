# Web Automation for Keycap Shopping

This Python-based project uses Selenium WebDriver to automatically navigate to a particular keycap selling website, checks for the availability of specified keycaps, and adds them to the cart.

## Background

### Motivation:
I embarked on this project primarily because I didn't want to miss out on a limited-edition keycap set. The goal was to have the program alert me when the keycaps came back in stock. Along the way, I wanted to challenge myself with a programming project outside of school.

### Reflection:
The journey taught me about planning and designing a program from scratch. Without predefined requirements, I had to delve deep into defining necessary functions and adaptabilities. While I gained foundational knowledge about using WebDrivers, I still eagerly await the day the keycaps come back in stock.

## Features

    **Stock Check**: Monitors the availability of the desired keycap set on the website and adds it to the cart if available.
    **Automated Checkout**: Proceeds to the checkout page and fills in the necessary details for purchase.
    **User Login**: Logs in the user using the provided email and password.
    **Payment Info**: Automates the process of entering payment details.

## Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

    Python
    Selenium
    Firefox web browser
    Gecko driver for Selenium (set your path in the PATH variable inside the script)


## Known Issues and Future Enhancements

  - The website structure changes frequently, which might render some parts of the automation ineffective.
  - As I continue to learn and grow in programming, I realize that some portions of the code can be more concise and efficient.
